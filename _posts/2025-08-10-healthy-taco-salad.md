### Ingredients

 - 2 corn tortillas, sliced into strips
 - Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
 - 1 medium head romaine lettuce, chopped
 - 1 cup shredded red cabbage
 - ½ cup cooked black beans, drained and rinsed
 - 2 red radishes, thinly sliced
 - ½ cup sliced cherry tomatoes and/or pico de gallo
 - 1 avocado, sliced
 - Jalapeno slices, optional
 - Cilantro Lime Dressing, the creamy avocado variation
 - Sea salt
 - Lime wedges, for serving
 - 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
 - 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and diced
 - 1 cup crushed walnuts
 - 1 tablespoon tamari
 - 1 teaspoon chili powder
 - ½ teaspoon balsamic vinegar
 - Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the tortilla strips with a tiny bit of olive oil and a few pinches of salt. Spread onto the sheet and bake for 10 to 14 minutes or until crispy.

Make the Shiitake Taco “Meat”: In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring only occasionally, until they begin to brown and soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the walnuts and lightly toast for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tamari and the chili powder. Add the balsamic vinegar and stir again. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Assemble the salad with the romaine lettuce, cabbage, black beans, taco meat, radishes, tomatoes, avocado, jalapenos, if using, and generous dollops of cilantro lime avocado dressing. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Serve with lime wedges and extra dressing on the side.
