        Creamy and crisp, rich yet bright, this vibrant, deeply savory oven-baked rice is all about contrast. The rice bakes slowly, absorbing the aromatic flavors of thyme, sweet onions and a citrusy pop of lemon, while a silky Tuscan kale purée brings an earthy depth. Just before serving, slices of halloumi are nestled on top, steaming until softened to give salty bursts. A scattering of crispy kale adds a final flourish. It’s an elegant dish, requiring little hands-on work but delivering layers of flavor.<p> Serves: 4 servings</p>
        <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>2 yellow onions, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, roughly chopped</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
  <li>1 cup/190 grams arborio rice</li>
  <li>1 lemon, skin peeled into 8 strips then finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon juice</li>
  <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
  <li>1 large bunch (about 10 ounces) Tuscan kale (also known as cavolo nero or dinosaur kale), leaves stripped from stems and roughly chopped into 2-inch pieces (stems discarded)</li>
  <li>7 ounces halloumi cheese, cut into 6 slices</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<p>Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</p>

<p>Mix the onions, 1/2 cup oil, thyme, salt and 2 tablespoons of water in a large, 12-inch cast-iron skillet or baking dish. (A Dutch oven would work as well, though you’ll achieve better color on top of the halloumi if you use a more shallow cooking vessel.) Bake for 15 minutes, until the onions are translucent and almost softened. Stir in the rice and lemon peel, and bake for a further 10 minutes to toast the rice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the stock and ½ cup of water and bring to a boil. Add the garlic and kale and cook for 3 minutes, just until the kale is cooked through. Strain the kale through a colander set over a bowl, reserving both the kale and the stock.</p>

<p>Transfer one-third of the kale to a baking sheet, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, toss to coat and spread in a single layer. Set aside.</p>

<p>Transfer the remaining kale, garlic and ½ cup stock to a blender and purée until smooth.</p>

<p>Mix the remaining stock into the rice and bake for a further 15 minutes, until the rice is al dente and most of the liquid is absorbed. Stir well to develop a starchy sauce, then stir in the kale purée and top with the halloumi slices. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil over the halloumi and return to the oven, along with the separate baking sheet of kale. Cook for 12 minutes until the halloumi is softened and the extra kale has crisped up, then remove from the oven.</p>

<p>Sprinkle the crispy kale over the rice dish, drizzle with the 1 tablespoon lemon juice and serve straight from the dish.</p>
